### latest
The react-scripts package provided by Create React App requires a dependency:
11:48:55 AM:   "webpack-dev-server": "3.11.1"
11:48:55 AM: 
11:48:55 AM: Don't try to install it manually: your package manager does it automatically.
However, a different version of webpack-dev-server was detected higher up in the tree:
11:48:55 AM:   /opt/build/repo/node_modules/webpack-dev-server (version: 3.11.2)
11:48:55 AM: Manually installing incompatible versions is known to cause hard-to-debug issues.
11:48:55 AM: If you would prefer to ignore this check, add SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true to an .env file in your project.
11:48:55 AM: That will permanently disable this message but you might encounter other issues.
11:48:55 AM: 
11:48:55 AM: To fix the dependency tree, try following the steps below in the exact order:
11:48:55 AM:   1. Delete package-lock.json (not package.json!) and/or yarn.lock in your project folder.
11:48:55 AM:   2. Delete node_modules in your project folder.
11:48:55 AM:   3. Remove "webpack-dev-server" from dependencies and/or devDependencies in the package.json file in your project folder.
11:48:55 AM:   4. Run npm install or yarn, depending on the package manager you use.
11:48:55 AM: In most cases, this should be enough to fix the problem.
11:48:55 AM: If this has not helped, there are a few other things you can try:
11:48:55 AM:   5. If you used npm, install yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/) and repeat the above steps with it instead.
11:48:55 AM:      This may help because npm has known issues with package hoisting which may get resolved in future versions.
11:48:55 AM:   6. Check if /opt/build/repo/node_modules/webpack-dev-server is outside your project directory.
11:48:55 AM:      For example, you might have accidentally installed something in your home folder.
11:48:55 AM:   7. Try running npm ls webpack-dev-server in your project folder.
11:48:55 AM:      This will tell you which other package (apart from the expected react-scripts) installed webpack-dev-server.
11:48:55 AM: If nothing else helps, add SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true to an .env file in your project.
11:48:55 AM: That would permanently disable this preflight check in case you want to proceed anyway.
11:48:55 AM: P.S. We know this message is long but please read the steps above :-) We hope you find them helpful!
